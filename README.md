Computation Practices 1 Homework 11 / Final Project

Concept: building a mini-sprite maker with pixel art images and sound.

How are you going to make it?
I am going to create a sprite/avatar maker template were the sprite will be on the left side of the screen while all the customization features are on the right side. For sections of what components that the sprite can be customized in, I want to include sections for skin color, eyes, shirt/tops, shorts/bottoms, shoes, and hair. I am thinking about a hat feature as well if I have time. There will be corresponding sounds for different features of the sprite maker. I would like to add a feature where the player can download their sprite after they completed customizing it. 
The player will click on a feature to dress up their sprite and that feature will pop up on their working sprite. They have to individually click on all the features of their choosing in order to get the sprite they want. The purpose is for the player to have a cute sprite by the end of their session and do whatever they please with it.

Components Parts
